# Homework1-ADM
Hallo!
Attached to this file you will find my accomplishment of Homework 1.
Within script.py and stamps.pdf there are the scripts of the challanges and the proof of their succesfull submission respectively.
In script2.py and stamps2.pdf there are the same informations only for Problem 2.

I find the homework very useful to the improvement of my programming skills in Python, especially for the Regex's part: I never worked with them!
I accomplished all the challanges, I don't think I've missed any coping the screenshots and the scripts in the "stamps" and "scripts" files; if you can't find one of them you can ask me.
